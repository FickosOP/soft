    "The process of Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down to five different steps:\n",

    "1. Apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image in order to remove the noise\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find the intensity gradients of the image\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Apply gradient magnitude thresholding or lower bound cut-off suppression to get rid of spurious response to edge detection\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Apply double threshold to determine potential edges\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Track edge by hysteresis: Finalize the detection of edges by suppressing all the other edges that are weak and not connected to strong edges.[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector)\n",

    "This method finds line segments in a binary image using the probabilistic Hough transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of Hough transform (HT) is to implement a voting procedure for all potential curves in the image, and at the termination of the algorithm, curves that do exist in the image will have relatively high voting scores. Randomized Hough transform (RHT) is different from HT in that it tries to avoid conducting the computationally expensive voting process for every nonzero pixel in the image by taking advantage of the geometric properties of analytical curves, and thus improve the time efficiency and reduce the storage requirement of the original algorithm.[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_Hough_transform)\n",
